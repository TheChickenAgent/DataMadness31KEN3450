## Installing Poetry

Poetry is a dependency manager which can be used to control versions of dependencies and Python. Dependencies can also be installed through the requirements.txt file which will be generated at the end of the project. When it's installed on your system, simply call ```poetry install``` and it will do the work for you. More information about Poetry can be found [here](https://python-poetry.org/).
